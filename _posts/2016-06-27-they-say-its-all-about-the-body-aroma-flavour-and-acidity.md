Who are They? to not consider the vessel or your environment

Give me the worlds most expensive coffee and serve it to me in a foam cup and stick me in the middle of peak hour on a sydney train, yuck

Go camping and boil up some crap instant on a cold morning with friends in a steel mug, yum

try it with water. good filtered water served in a foam cup and same water served in a bohemian crystal glass. which tastes better?
