### They say its all about the Body, Aroma, Flavour and Acidity.

### **They are not completely Wrong.**

### Who are They anyhow? to not consider your vessel or your environment.

### Give me the worlds most expensive coffee and serve it to me in a foam cup and stick me in the middle of peak hour on a City train, yuck!! 

### Go camping and boil up some crap instant on a cold morning with friends in a steel mug, yum'ish.

### Try my point with water. Use good filtered water served in a foam cup and the same water served in a bohemian crystal glass.

### _which tastes better? and consider your chosen environment to enjoy either_
